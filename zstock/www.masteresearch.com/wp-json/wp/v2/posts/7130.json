External factors, including the OPEC+ output cut and \u201cthe spillover of all the decisions\u201d related to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine are \u201cthe two main things which I think I\u2019d be more worried about than anything internal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also said weakness in demand for manufacturing goods and services activity could be a drag on India\u2019s recovery going forward.<br \/>\nThe Reserve Bank of India has found reasonable justification to pause for now, Sitharaman said. \u201cThey are keeping a very close eye on the economy and business leaders have welcomed this pause with a sense of relief.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The central bank has given a hawkish outlook for India\u2019s inflation, but the price-gain trajectory will depend of monsoon rainfall going ahead, she said.<br \/>\nWe hope to continue on the glide path,\u201d she said, adding that the government will adhere to the budgeted target of 5.9% for the fiscal year starting April. \u201cWe have been careful.\u201d<br \/>\nIn India, privatization goes through a whole lot of filters as all stakeholders have to be kept together, Sitharaman said when asked about the slow progress of stake sales in state-run firms. \u201cThe idea is not to close units down, it\u2019s more that the government wants to get out of businesses where more equity is not possible but there\u2019s interest outside and the economy will benefit if the companies are kept as going concern, so those considerations do take time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Government of India stays at a distance from companies,\u201d the minister said, adding that a Supreme Court-monitored panel will probe allegations made by the US short-seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group. \u201cWe think it may be inappropriate to comment even as the judiciary is having a look at it.\u201d<br \/>\nMore reports show that cryptocurrencies have macro-stability implications, Sitharaman said. If there\u2019s a consensus among G-20 members, \u201cwe will look at a broad framework and will leave it to each country to adopt their own legislative framework,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5xdb7h59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/5xdb7h59<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India\u2019s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the South Asian nation could buy Russian crude oil near or past the price cap imposed by the G-7 if the recent OPEC+ output cut increases energy costs. \u201cWe will have to constantly re-figure where we get the best deal as it is a critical input for the economy,\u201d&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":7131,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_themeisle_gutenberg_block_has_review":false},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"wppr_data":{"cwp_meta_box_check":"No"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7130"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7130"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7130\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7132,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7130\/revisions\/7132"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7131"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7130"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7130"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.masteresearch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7130"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
